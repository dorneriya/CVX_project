# CVX project
Implementation of the Gradient Descent method, in order to solve a convex optimization problem with constraints.

We were given a task to find an optimal minimum point on the function:

Tr(SK)-Log(det(K)) w.r.t K.
Where S is a given symmetric matrix and K is a k-band matrix (k is given).
